"### 27. Schema Definitions

The app has some schemas defined with Pydantic. These schemas are used for data validation and serialization.

User schema has fields like email and password. Order schema has fields like items and status.

The schemas are in the app/schemas folder. They're used by the API endpoints to validate request and response data.

Pydantic does some validation but I'm not sure exactly what rules are applied. Probably email validation and stuff like that.

The schemas might have some relationships but it's not clear from the documentation.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from multiple files and subfolders into cohesive, accurate documentation.

Key Requirements:
- Focus on factual information derived directly from the provided documentation
- Maintain consistent terminology across sections
- Highlight relationships and dependencies between components
- Use clear, precise language without speculation
- Include only information that is explicitly present in the source documentation

"### 28. CRUD Operations

The app has CRUD operations for users and orders. These operations interact with the database.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are basic database operations.

The CRUD functions are in the app/crud folder. They use SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.

Example operations:
- create_user
- get_user
- update_user
- delete_user

Similar operations exist for orders. The functions take parameters and return data from the database.

Error handling is probably implemented but details are unclear.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from multiple files and subfolders into cohesive, accurate documentation.

"### 29. Authentication Flow

The app uses JWT for authentication. JWT stands for JSON Web Token.

Authentication flow:
1. User provides credentials
2. System checks credentials
3. If valid, JWT token is created
4. Token is returned to user
5. User includes token in future requests

The token has an expiration time. After that, the user needs to login again.

The token is included in the Authorization header with the Bearer prefix.

The system probably has refresh tokens but I don't see them in the documentation.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation.

"### 30. Middleware Components

The app has some middleware components. Middleware processes requests before they reach the endpoints.

Possible middleware includes:
- CORS middleware
- Authentication middleware
- Logging middleware

Middleware is configured in the main.py file. It's applied to all requests.

CORS middleware allows cross-origin requests from certain domains. Authentication middleware checks tokens.

There might be other middleware but it's not mentioned in the documentation.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation.

"### 31. Database Migrations

The app uses Alembic for database migrations. Migrations are in the alembic folder.

Migrations track changes to the database schema. They allow upgrading and downgrading the database.

To run migrations:
```
alembic upgrade head
```

To create a new migration:
```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
```

Migrations are applied automatically when the app starts up probably.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation.
