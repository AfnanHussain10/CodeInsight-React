"### 8. Folder Dependencies

**External Dependencies**

The `pages` folder in the Next-Shopify project relies on several external dependencies to fulfill its functionality:

* **Next.js**: The core framework that powers the page routing and rendering system. The pages folder structure directly maps to URL routes following Next.js conventions.

* **React**: Used for creating all page components and managing component state.

* **React Context API**: Used through the custom context providers in the `context` folder to access cart state and functions.

**Internal Dependencies**

The `pages` folder has dependencies on several other folders within the project:

* **Components Folder**: The pages use various UI components from the `components` folder to build their interfaces:
  * `Layout`: Used in `_app.js` to provide consistent structure across all pages
  * `SEO`: Used in multiple pages for setting page metadata
  * `ProductListings`: Used in `index.js` to display product listings
  * `ProductSection`: Used in `products/[product].js` to display product details
  * `CartTable`, `CheckOutButton`, `BackToProductButton`: Used in `cart.js` for cart functionality

* **Context Folder**: The pages use context providers and hooks from the `context` folder:
  * `useCartContext`: Used in `cart.js` to access cart state
  * `useAddToCartContext`: Used indirectly through product components
  * `useUpdateCartQuantityContext`: Used indirectly through cart components

* **Lib Folder**: The pages use functions from the `lib` folder for data fetching:
  * `getAllProductsInCollection`: Used in `getStaticProps` of `index.js`
  * `getProductSlugs`: Used in `getStaticPaths` of `products/[product].js`
  * `getProduct`: Used in `getStaticProps` of `products/[product].js`

* **Utils Folder**: The pages indirectly use utility functions from the `utils` folder through the context and components.

**Dependency Graph**

The dependency relationships of the `pages` folder can be visualized as follows:

```
pages/
  ├── depends on → components/
  ├── depends on → context/
  ├── depends on → lib/
  └── indirectly depends on → utils/
```

**Version Constraints**

The `pages` folder functionality is constrained by the following version dependencies:

* **Next.js**: Version ^12.1.0 as specified in `package.json`
* **React**: Version ^17.0.2 as specified in `package.json`

These version constraints ensure compatibility between the page components and the underlying framework features they utilize.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

"### 9. Folder Examples

**Common Use Cases**

The `lib` folder provides essential functionality for interacting with the Shopify API. Here are some common use cases with examples:

**1. Fetching All Products**

To retrieve all products from a collection for display on the homepage:

```javascript
import { getAllProductsInCollection } from '../lib/shopify';

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const products = await getAllProductsInCollection();
  
  return {
    props: {
      products
    }
  };
}
```

This example shows how the `getAllProductsInCollection` function is used in the `getStaticProps` function of the index page to fetch products during build time.

**2. Generating Dynamic Product Pages**

To generate paths for all product pages during static site generation:

```javascript
import { getProductSlugs } from '../lib/shopify';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const productSlugs = await getProductSlugs();
  
  const paths = productSlugs.map((slug) => {
    return {
      params: { product: slug.node.handle }
    };
  });
  
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false
  };
}
```

This example demonstrates how `getProductSlugs` is used in the `getStaticPaths` function to create dynamic routes for product pages.

**3. Fetching Individual Product Details**

To retrieve details for a specific product by its handle:

```javascript
import { getProduct } from '../lib/shopify';

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const productData = await getProduct(params.product);
  
  return {
    props: {
      productData
    }
  };
}
```

This example shows how the `getProduct` function is used to fetch data for a specific product based on its handle (slug).

**4. Creating a New Checkout**

To create a new checkout when a user adds their first item to the cart:

```javascript
import { createCheckout } from '../lib/shopify';
import { saveLocalData } from '../utils/helpers';

async function addFirstItemToCart(variantId, quantity) {
  const checkout = await createCheckout(variantId, quantity);
  
  const cart = [{
    variantId,
    quantity,
    // Additional product details
  }];
  
  saveLocalData(cart, checkout.id, checkout.webUrl);
  
  return checkout;
}
```

This example demonstrates how `createCheckout` might be used to initialize a new checkout process when a user adds their first item to the cart.

**5. Updating an Existing Checkout**

To update an existing checkout when a user modifies their cart:

```javascript
import { updateCheckout } from '../lib/shopify';

async function updateExistingCheckout(checkoutId, lineItems) {
  const updatedCheckout = await updateCheckout(checkoutId, lineItems);
  
  return updatedCheckout;
}
```

This example shows how `updateCheckout` might be used to modify an existing checkout when the cart contents change.

**Integration Examples**

The functions in the `lib` folder are typically integrated with other parts of the application:

**1. Integration with React Context**

```javascript
import { createCheckout, updateCheckout } from '../lib/shopify';

function CartProvider({ children }) {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);
  const [checkoutId, setCheckoutId] = useState('');
  const [checkoutUrl, setCheckoutUrl] = useState('');
  
  async function addToCart(newItem) {
    if (cart.length === 0) {
      const checkout = await createCheckout(newItem.variantId, newItem.quantity);
      setCheckoutId(checkout.id);
      setCheckoutUrl(checkout.webUrl);
      // Update cart and save data
    } else {
      const lineItems = cart.map(item => ({
        variantId: item.variantId,
        quantity: item.quantity
      }));
      await updateCheckout(checkoutId, lineItems);
      // Update cart and save data
    }
  }
  
  // Additional context code
}
```

This example shows how the Shopify API functions might be integrated with a React context provider to manage cart state.

**2. Integration with Next.js Data Fetching**

```javascript
// pages/index.js
import { getAllProductsInCollection } from '../lib/shopify';
import ProductListings from '../components/ProductListings';

export default function IndexPage({ products }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Products</h1>
      <ProductListings products={products} />
    </div>
  );
}

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const products = await getAllProductsInCollection();
  
  return {
    props: {
      products
    },
    revalidate: 60 // Revalidate every 60 seconds
  };
}
```

This example demonstrates how the Shopify API functions are integrated with Next.js data fetching methods to provide data for page rendering.

These examples illustrate the versatility and importance of the `lib` folder in connecting the application to the Shopify API and enabling core e-commerce functionality.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

"### 12. Component Organization

**Component Hierarchy**

The user-order-fastapi project follows a well-structured component hierarchy that organizes code by functionality and responsibility:

* **API Components** (`app/api/`)
  * API Router: Central router that aggregates all endpoint routers
  * User Endpoints: Routes for user registration, authentication, and management
  * Order Endpoints: Routes for order creation, retrieval, and management
  * Dependencies: Reusable dependency injection components for authentication and permissions

* **Core Components** (`app/core/`)
  * Configuration: Application settings and environment variable management
  * Security: Authentication, authorization, and password handling
  * Database: Database connection and session management

* **Data Access Components** (`app/crud/`)
  * User CRUD: Database operations for user entities
  * Order CRUD: Database operations for order entities
  * Base CRUD: Generic CRUD operations for reuse across entities

* **Data Model Components** (`app/db/`)
  * Base Model: Common fields and methods for all database models
  * User Model: Database schema for user entities
  * Order Model: Database schema for order entities
  * Relationships: Definitions of relationships between models

* **Schema Components** (`app/schemas/`)
  * User Schemas: Pydantic models for user request/response validation
  * Order Schemas: Pydantic models for order request/response validation
  * Token Schemas: Pydantic models for authentication tokens

**Component Interfaces**

Components in the user-order-fastapi project communicate through well-defined interfaces:

* **API to Service Layer**: API endpoints call service functions with validated request data
* **Service to Data Access Layer**: Service functions use CRUD operations to interact with the database
* **Data Access to Database Layer**: CRUD operations use SQLAlchemy models and sessions
* **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Components use dependency injection for authentication and database sessions

The interfaces between components are designed to be explicit and type-safe, leveraging Python's type hints and Pydantic's validation capabilities.

**State Management**

The application manages state through several mechanisms:

* **Database State**: Persistent state stored in PostgreSQL database
* **Session State**: User authentication state managed through JWT tokens
* **Request State**: Request-scoped state managed through FastAPI's dependency injection system
* **Application State**: Global application state managed through FastAPI's app state and lifespan events

State management follows best practices for web applications, avoiding shared mutable state and preferring explicit state passing through function parameters and return values.

**Component Reusability**

The project emphasizes component reusability through several patterns:

* **Base Classes**: Common functionality extracted to base classes (e.g., BaseCRUD)
* **Generic Functions**: Type-parameterized functions for reuse across different entity types
* **Dependency Injection**: Reusable dependencies for common concerns like authentication
* **Pydantic Models**: Inheritance and composition of schema models for DRY validation logic

These reusability patterns reduce code duplication and ensure consistent behavior across the application. Components are designed with clear responsibilities and interfaces, making them easier to test, maintain, and extend.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation.
