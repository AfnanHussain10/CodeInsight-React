"### 14. Key Functions

**Core Functionality**

The `app/api` folder contains several key functions that form the core of the user-order-fastapi application's API layer. These functions can be categorized into the following groups:

**User Management Functions**

* Authentication functions are used as dependencies for protected endpoints
* User management functions depend on the user CRUD operations in the `crud` folder
* Order management functions depend on both user and order CRUD operations
* All API functions depend on the database session provided through dependency injection

These functions form the interface between the client applications and the business logic of the user-order-fastapi system, ensuring secure and consistent API behavior.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

"### 15. Folder Architecture

**Folder Structure**

The `app/db` folder in the user-order-fastapi project contains the database models and session management code. The folder is organized with the following structure:

```
app/db/
├── base.py       # Imports all models for Alembic migrations
├── base_class.py # Base model class with common fields and methods
├── init_db.py    # Database initialization functions
├── session.py    # Database session management
└── models/       # Database model definitions
    ├── user.py   # User model definition
    └── order.py  # Order model definition
```

This structure separates concerns related to database connectivity, model definitions, and initialization logic.

**Design Patterns**

The `app/db` folder implements several key design patterns:

* **Repository Pattern**: The models provide an abstraction layer over the database tables, encapsulating the data access logic.

* **Active Record Pattern**: The SQLAlchemy models combine data access and domain logic in a single class, following the Active Record pattern.

* **Unit of Work Pattern**: The database session management implements the Unit of Work pattern, tracking changes to objects and persisting them as a single transaction.

* **Base Class Pattern**: Common fields and methods are extracted to a base class, promoting code reuse and consistency across models.

**Code Organization**

The code within the `app/db` folder is organized into logical components:

* **Base Classes**: The `base_class.py` file defines the `Base` class that all models inherit from, providing common functionality like primary key definition and timestamp fields.

* **Session Management**: The `session.py` file contains functions for creating and managing database sessions, including connection pooling and transaction handling.

* **Model Definitions**: The `models` directory contains individual model files, each defining a specific database entity with its fields, relationships, and methods.

* **Database Initialization**: The `init_db.py` file contains functions for initializing the database, including creating tables and seeding initial data.

* **Migration Support**: The `base.py` file imports all models to ensure they are discovered by Alembic for migration generation.

**File Responsibilities**

Each file in the `app/db` folder has specific responsibilities:

* **base.py**: Aggregates all models for Alembic migrations, ensuring that all model changes are detected when generating migrations.

* **base_class.py**: Defines the base model class with common fields (id, created_at, updated_at) and methods that all models inherit.

* **session.py**: Manages database connections and sessions, providing functions to create and close database sessions.

* **init_db.py**: Contains functions to initialize the database, create tables, and seed initial data if needed.

* **models/user.py**: Defines the User model with fields like email, hashed_password, is_active, and is_superuser, along with relationships to other models.

* **models/order.py**: Defines the Order model with fields like status, total_amount, and created_at, along with relationships to the User model and potentially other models.

This organization ensures a clean separation of concerns while providing a cohesive database layer for the application.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

"### 16. Folder Dependencies

**External Dependencies**

The `app/schemas` folder in the user-order-fastapi project relies on several external dependencies to fulfill its functionality:

* **Pydantic**: The core library used for defining schema models with validation. All schema classes inherit from Pydantic's BaseModel.

* **Python Type Hints**: Standard Python typing module for type annotations, including List, Optional, Dict, and Any.

* **Email Validator**: Used indirectly through Pydantic for validating email addresses in user schemas.

* **datetime**: Standard Python module used for date and time field types.

**Internal Dependencies**

The `app/schemas` folder has dependencies on several other folders within the project:

* **app/db/models**: The schema definitions mirror the structure of database models, creating a parallel representation for API input/output.

* **app/core/security**: Some schemas may reference security-related functions for password handling and token validation.

The schemas folder is designed to be relatively independent, with other parts of the application depending on it rather than the other way around. This helps maintain a clean architecture with clear data flow.

**Dependency Graph**

The dependency relationships of the `app/schemas` folder can be visualized as follows:

```
External Dependencies:
  Pydantic
  Python Type Hints
  Email Validator
  datetime

Internal Dependencies:
  app/schemas/ → app/db/models (reference only)
  app/schemas/ → app/core/security (reference only)

Dependent Components:
  app/api/ → app/schemas/
  app/crud/ → app/schemas/
```

This graph shows that while the schemas folder has minimal dependencies itself, it is a critical dependency for the API and CRUD layers of the application.

**Version Constraints**

The `app/schemas` folder functionality is constrained by the following version dependencies:

* **Pydantic**: Version >=1.8.2 as specified in requirements.txt
* **Python**: Version 3.8+ (implied by FastAPI requirements)

These version constraints ensure that the schema validation and serialization features work correctly and consistently across different environments.

**Import Structure**

The import structure within the `app/schemas` folder typically follows this pattern:

```python
# Standard library imports
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional, Any

# Third-party imports
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, EmailStr, validator

# Internal imports (minimal or none)
# from app.core.security import verify_password  # Only if needed
```

This import structure reflects the minimal dependencies of the schemas folder, focusing primarily on Pydantic and standard Python libraries.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.
