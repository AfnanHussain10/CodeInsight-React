Folder Documentation:
Folder: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\lib
#### Common Use Cases

The `shopify.js` module provides several functions for interacting with Shopify. Here are some complete, runnable examples:

```javascript
// Import the necessary functions from shopify.js
import { getAllProductsInCollection, createCheckout } from './shopify';

// Example 1: Retrieving all products in a collection
/**
 * Retrieves all products in a collection.
 *
 * Returns a promise that resolves with an array of products.
 */
getAllProductsInCollection().then((products) => {
  console.log(products);
});

// Example 2: Creating a new checkout
/**
 * Creates a new checkout.
 *
 * @param {string} variantId - The ID of the product variant.
 * @param {number} quantity - The quantity of the product.
 *
 * Returns a promise that resolves with the checkout object.
 */
createCheckout('variant-id', 2).then((checkout) => {
  console.log(checkout);
});
```

#### Integration Examples

See below for an example of how to use the `shopify.js` module functions together:

```javascript
// Retrieve all products in a collection and create a checkout for a specific product
getAllProductsInCollection().then((products) => {
  const product = products.find((product) => product.id === 'product-id');
  if (product) {
    createCheckout(product.variants[0].id, 2).then((checkout) => {
      console.log(checkout);
    });
  } else {
    console.error('Product not found');
  }
});
```

Best practices:

* Use the `getAllProductsInCollection` function to retrieve all products in a collection before creating a checkout.
* Use the `createCheckout` function to create a new checkout for a specific product variant.

Note: The `variant-id` and `product-id` placeholders should be replaced with the actual IDs of the product variants and products, respectively.

Folder: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\context
#### Common Use Cases

The `Store.js` file provides context API hooks for managing cart data. Here are some common use cases:

**Using `useCartContext` to Access Cart Data**

```jsx
import { useCartContext } from './Store';

function CartComponent() {
  const [cart, checkoutUrl, isLoading] = useCartContext();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Cart</h2>
      <ul>
        {cart.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.variantId}>{item.name} x {item.variantQuantity}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>Checkout URL: {checkoutUrl}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Expected Inputs and Outputs**

* `useCartContext` returns an array containing `cart`, `checkoutUrl`, and `isLoading`.
* `cart` is an array of objects with `variantId`, `name`, and `variantQuantity` properties.
* `checkoutUrl` is a string representing the URL for checking out.
* `isLoading` is a boolean indicating whether the cart data is loading.

**Using `useAddToCartContext` to Add Items to the Cart**

```jsx
import { useAddToCartContext } from './Store';

function ProductComponent() {
  const addToCart = useAddToCartContext();

  const handleAddToCart = () => {
    const newItem = {
      variantId: 'variant-1',
      name: 'Product 1',
      variantQuantity: 1,
    };
    addToCart(newItem);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Product 1</h2>
      <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Integration Examples

The `useCartContext` and `useAddToCartContext` hooks can be used together to manage cart data in a child component. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { useCartContext, useAddToCartContext } from './Store';

function CartComponent() {
  const [cart, checkoutUrl, isLoading] = useCartContext();
  const addToCart = useAddToCartContext();

  const handleAddToCart = () => {
    const newItem = {
      variantId: 'variant-1',
      name: 'Product 1',
      variantQuantity: 1,
    };
    addToCart(newItem);
  };

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Cart</h2>
      <ul>
        {cart.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.variantId}>{item.name} x {item.variantQuantity}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>Checkout URL: {checkoutUrl}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Best Practices**

* Always use the `useCartContext` hook to access cart data in child components.
* Use the `useAddToCartContext` hook to add new items to the cart.
* Ensure that the `cart` array is not mutated directly. Instead, use the `addToCart` function to update the cart data.

This example demonstrates how to save local data using the `saveLocalData` function. This function takes three parameters: `cart`, `checkoutId`, and `checkoutUrl`.

```javascript
/**
 * Saves local data
 * @param {Array} cart - Cart items
 * @param {string} checkoutId - Checkout ID
 * @param {string} checkoutUrl - Checkout URL
 */
const cart = [...]; // Initialize cart items
const checkoutId = 'abc123'; // Initialize checkout ID
const checkoutUrl = 'https://example.com/checkout'; // Initialize checkout URL
saveLocalData(cart, checkoutId, checkoutUrl);
```

Expected Output:
The `saveLocalData` function will save the provided cart items, checkout ID, and checkout URL locally.

##### Creating a Shopify Checkout

This example illustrates how to create a Shopify checkout using the `createShopifyCheckout` function. This function takes an object with `variantId` and `variantQuantity` as parameters and returns a promise that resolves with checkout data.

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a Shopify checkout
 * @param {Object} newItem - Checkout item details
 * @param {string} newItem.variantId - Variant ID
 * @param {number} newItem.variantQuantity - Variant quantity
 * @returns {Promise} Resolves with checkout data
 */
const newItem = {
  variantId: 'xyz789', // Initialize variant ID
  variantQuantity: 2 // Initialize variant quantity
};
createShopifyCheckout(newItem).then((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Log checkout data
});
```

Expected Output:
The `createShopifyCheckout` function will create a Shopify checkout with the provided variant ID and quantity and log the checkout data in the console.

#### Integration Examples

These examples demonstrate how to use the `saveLocalData` and `createShopifyCheckout` functions in conjunction with other components.

Note: Integration examples with other components are not explicitly present in the provided source documentation. Therefore, we will not provide any examples in this section.

Best Practices:

* Ensure proper error handling when using the `createShopifyCheckout` function, as it returns a promise that may reject with an error.
* Verify the correctness of the data passed to the `saveLocalData` function to avoid saving invalid data.

Performance Optimization Examples:

* Optimize the `createShopifyCheckout` function by caching the results of recently created checkouts to reduce the number of requests to the Shopify API.
* Minimize the amount of data saved by the `saveLocalData` function to reduce storage usage.

Cross-references:

* `saveLocalData`: Use this function to save the cart items and checkout ID after creating a Shopify checkout.
* `createShopifyCheckout`: Use this function in conjunction with the `saveLocalData` function to create a Shopify checkout and save the cart items and checkout ID locally.

**Project Structure**
The Next-Shopify project is organized into the following key folders:

* `components`: contains React components used throughout the project
* `context`: provides context functions for accessing and modifying cart data
* `lib`: houses utility functions for interacting with the Shopify API
* `pages`: contains page-level components for the application
* `utils`: includes helper functions for data operations
* `uploaded_projects/Next-Shopify/next-shopify-starter-main`: the root directory of the project

**Core Components**
The major subsystems of the Next-Shopify project include:

* `Store.js`: provides context functions for accessing and modifying cart data
* `Layout.js`: wraps page content and provides a common layout structure
* `CartTable.js`: displays cart data and allows users to update cart quantities
* `ProductSection.js`: displays product details and integrates `ProductImage.js` and `ProductDetails.js`
* `ProductListings.js`: displays product cards and integrates `ProductCard.js`

**Integration Points**
The Next-Shopify project integrates components and subsystems through the following means:

* **Internal component interactions**:
	+ `CartTable.js` imports `useUpdateCartQuantityContext` from `@/context/Store` to update cart quantities
	+ `Nav.js` imports `useCartContext` from `@/context/Store` to display cart data
	+ `ProductForm.js` imports `useAddToCartContext` from `@/context/Store` to add items to cart context
* **External system interfaces**:
	+ `helpers.js` imports functions from `@/lib/shopify` to facilitate Shopify API interactions
* **API endpoints**:
	+ `getAllProductsInCollection` and `getProduct` functions in `@/lib/shopify` facilitate data retrieval from the Shopify API
* **Data flow patterns**:
	+ Cart data flows from `Store.js` to `CartTable.js` and `Nav.js` through context functions
	+ Product data flows from `ProductListings.js` to `ProductSection.js` through component integration

Note: The provided documentation does not explicitly mention certain aspects of the project, such as event handling and state management. Therefore, these topics are not included in this section.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from root-level files and immediate child folders into cohesive, accurate project documentation.

Key Requirements:
- Create high-level project documentation that provides a clear overview of the entire system
- Synthesize information from both files and folders documentations to create a complete picture
- Maintain consistent terminology and technical accuracy
- Focus on project-wide patterns, architectures, and relationships
- Include only information that is explicitly present in the source documentation
- If no source documentation is available for a section, clearly state that the information is not available

Folder Documentation:
Folder: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\context
**Component Dependencies**

The `Store.js` file, located in the `context` folder, interacts with other files through the following relationships:

* Import dependencies from `@/utils/helpers`:
	+ `createShopifyCheckout`
	+ `updateShopifyCheckout`
	+ `setLocalData`
	+ `saveLocalData`
* Parent-component relationship: `CartProvider`
* Child-component relationships:
	+ `useCartContext`
	+ `useAddToCartContext`
	+ `useUpdateCartQuantityContext`

**File Dependencies and Import Hierarchy**
```plain
(context)
|-- Store.js (imports from @/utils/helpers)
|    |-- createShopifyCheckout
|    |-- updateShopifyCheckout
|    |-- setLocalData
|    |-- saveLocalData
|-- ... (other files in context folder)
|-- ... (other folders)
|-- utils
    |-- helpers.js (exported functions used by Store.js)
```

**Data Flow between Components**

* `Store.js` exports context functions (`useCartContext`, `useAddToCartContext`, `useUpdateCartQuantityContext`) that are used by child components to access and modify cart data.
* Child components interact with `CartProvider` to access and modify cart data.

**Communication Patterns**

* Inter-module communication: `Store.js` imports functions from `@/utils/helpers` to facilitate data operations.
* Event handling: Not explicitly specified in the provided documentation.
* State management: `Store.js` manages cart data state, providing context functions for child components to interact with it.
* Resource sharing: `Store.js` shares cart data state with child components through context functions.

Note: The provided documentation does not explicitly mention event handling, but it does describe the interaction between `Store.js` and other files in the context folder.

Folder: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\utils
**Component Dependencies**

The `helpers.js` file within the `./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\utils` folder demonstrates the following dependencies:

*   **Imports**: The `helpers.js` file imports functions from `@/lib/shopify`, specifically `createCheckout` and `updateCheckout`. This establishes a dependency on the `shopify` module for checkout-related operations.
*   **Local Storage**: The `helpers.js` file uses local storage, which may be accessed by other files in the project. This shared resource could serve as an integration point for inter-module communication.

Here is a high-level representation of the import hierarchy:
```markdown
./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\
|- utils\
    |- helpers.js (imports createCheckout and updateCheckout from @/lib/shopify)
|- lib\
    |- shopify (exports createCheckout and updateCheckout)
```

**Communication Patterns**

While there is limited information available in the provided documentation, we can infer the following communication patterns:

*   **Inter-Module Communication**: The `helpers.js` file's use of local storage and imports from `@/lib/shopify` suggests that modules within the project may communicate with each other through shared resources and function imports.
*   **Event Handling**: There is no explicit information about event handling in the provided documentation.
*   **State Management**: Local storage usage in `helpers.js` implies some form of state management, although the specifics of this are not detailed in the documentation.
*   **Resource Sharing**: The `helpers.js` file's access to local storage and imported functions indicates resource sharing between modules.

Please note that these communication patterns are inferred and may require additional documentation for a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture.

**Data Flow between Components**

The components in this folder exchange data through the following means:

* `useContext` hook in `CartTable.js` to access cart quantity context
* `useCartContext` hook in `Nav.js` to access cart context
* `useAddToCartContext` hook in `ProductForm.js` to add items to cart context
* Imported components in `Layout.js` to wrap page content
* Imported components in `ProductSection.js` to display product details
* Imported component in `ProductListings.js` to display product cards

**Communication Patterns**

The components in this folder communicate through the following means:

* Event handling: `ProductForm.js` handles add-to-cart events
* State management: `CartTable.js`, `Nav.js`, and `ProductForm.js` use context to manage cart state
* Resource sharing: `Layout.js` wraps page content, sharing layout resources
* Integration points: `ProductSection.js` integrates `ProductImage.js` and `ProductDetails.js`, while `ProductListings.js` integrates `ProductCard.js`

**Folder Overview**
The `pages` folder is a critical component of a Next.js application integrated with Shopify. It serves as the primary location for managing page components within the application. The folder's contents include various React page components, such as `_app.js`, `index.js`, `cart.js`, and `_document.js`, which provide universal layout, SEO metadata, and navigation options for the application. Additionally, a subfolder `products` is present to handle the display of individual product information.

**Purpose and Scope**
This folder serves as a central location for managing page components within the Next.js application. Its main responsibilities include:

* Providing a universal layout and SEO metadata to all pages within the application
* Rendering dynamic product pages for individual products
* Managing page components, such as cart and index pages, within the application

Core problems solved by this folder include:

* Providing an efficient and scalable way to handle the display of individual product information

Subfolders Documentation:
Subfolder: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\pages\products
Architecture: **Design Patterns**

The architecture of the pages within the `products` folder centers around Next.js's static site generation (SSG) features. The key design pattern observed is the use of server-side rendering (SSR) to enhance SEO and user experience.

Specifically, the `[product].js` file utilizes modular design by importing necessary components (`ProductSection`) and utility functions (`getProductSlugs`, `getProduct`) from other parts of the application. This approach promotes reusability and maintainability of code.

**Technical Decisions**

The use of Next.js's SSG features, specifically `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`, enables pre-rendering of product pages at build time. This key architectural choice enhances performance and scalability by reducing the load on the server during runtime.

By leveraging SSR, the application can improve SEO and provide a better user experience. The modular design approach and use of utility functions also facilitate easier maintenance and updates to the application.

**Component Interactions**

The `[product].js` file interacts with other components and utility functions within the application, including `ProductSection`, `getProductSlugs`, and `getProduct`. These interactions enable the retrieval and rendering of product data on the client-side.

**Relationships and Dependencies**

The pages within the `products` folder rely on the following dependencies:

* Next.js's SSG features (`getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`)
* Utility functions (`getProductSlugs` and `getProduct`)
* Component (`ProductSection`)

These dependencies facilitate the pre-rendering of product pages, retrieval of product data, and rendering of product components on the client-side.

#### Folder Overview

The `pages` folder in the Next-Shopify project contains various page components, including `_app.js`, `index.js`, `cart.js`, and `_document.js`. Each file serves a specific purpose in rendering the application.

#### Common Use Cases

**Rendering a Page with MyApp Component**

The `_app.js` file demonstrates how to render a page with the `MyApp` component, which wraps a page component with the `Layout` and includes the `SEO` component for metadata.

```jsx
// _app.js
import Layout from '@/components/Layout'
import SEO from '@/components/SEO'
import '@/styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title={process.env.siteTitle} />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

**Rendering the Index Page**

The `index.js` file shows how to render the `IndexPage` component with a sample `products` array.

```jsx
// index.js
import IndexPage from './index';

const products = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Product 1' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Product 2' },
];

const indexPage = <IndexPage products={products} />;
```

**Rendering the Cart Page**

The `cart.js` file demonstrates how to render the `CartPage` component within a larger application.

```jsx
// cart.js
import React from 'react';
import CartPage from './cart';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <CartPage />
    </div>
  );
};
```

**Using the Custom Document Component**

The `_document.js` file provides an example of using the custom document component in a Next.js page.

```jsx
// _document.js
import MyDocument from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  // ...
}

export default MyDocument;
```

To use the custom document component, import it in your page file and use it as the document component.

```jsx
// index.js
import MyDocument from '../pages/_document';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my homepage</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

#### Integration Examples

**Product Page**

The `products` subfolder contains a `ProductPage` component that can be used to render a product page. To use it, pass `productData` as a prop.

```jsx
// products/[product].js
import ProductPage from './[product]';

// Assuming productData is fetched or provided
const productData = { /* product details */ };

const Product = () => {
  return <ProductPage productData={productData} />;
};
```

**Custom Document Component**

The custom document component can be used to customize the HTML structure of the document.

```jsx
// _document.js
import MyDocument from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang=""en"">
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
          <script src=""https://example.com/script.js"" />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```

#### Best Practices

* When using the `ProductPage` component, ensure that you have fetched the necessary `productData` using `getStaticProps` or another data fetching mechanism.
* Use the custom document component to customize the HTML structure of the document.

#### Related Components

* `ProductPage`: The component used to render a product page.
* `getStaticProps`: A Next.js API used for server-side rendering and data fetching.
* `MyDocument`: The custom document component used to customize the HTML structure of the document.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

Context:
Folder Path: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\pages
Section: folder_examples

Files Documentation:
File: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\pages\_app.js
Code Snippets and Examples: - **Example 1**: Rendering a page with the `MyApp` component.
```jsx
import Layout from '@/components/Layout'
import SEO from '@/components/SEO'
import '@/styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <SEO title={process.env.siteTitle} />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```
This example demonstrates how the `MyApp` component wraps a page component with the `Layout` and includes the `SEO` component for metadata.
File: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\pages\index.js
Code Snippets and Examples: **Example 1**: Rendering the Index Page
```jsx
import IndexPage from './index';

const products = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Product 1' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Product 2' },
];

const indexPage = <IndexPage products={products} />;
```
This example demonstrates how to render the `IndexPage` component with a sample `products` array.
File: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\pages\cart.js
Code Snippets and Examples: **Example 1**: Rendering the Cart Page
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import CartPage from './cart';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <CartPage />
    </div>
  );
};
```
Note: This example assumes that the `CartPage` component is imported and rendered within a larger application. The actual implementation may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements.
File: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\pages\_document.js
Code Snippets and Examples: **Example 1**: To use the custom document component in a Next.js page, you would import the `MyDocument` class and use it as the document component.
```jsx
import MyDocument from '../pages/_document';

// Use the MyDocument class as the document component
```
Note: This example is not a direct code snippet from the file, but rather an illustration of how to use the custom document component in a Next.js page. 

To use the custom document component, you would typically create a new page in your Next.js project and import the `MyDocument` class. The `MyDocument` class would then be used as the document component for that page. 

For instance, if you have a page called `index.js`, you can use the `MyDocument` class as follows:
```jsx
// pages/_document.js
import MyDocument from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  // ...
}

export default MyDocument;
```

```jsx
// pages/index.js
import MyDocument from '../pages/_document';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my homepage</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```
In this example, the `MyDocument` class is used as the document component for the `HomePage` page. 

**Example 2**: To customize the HTML structure of the document, you can modify the `render` method of the `MyDocument` class.
```jsx
// pages/_document.js
import MyDocument from 'next/document';

class MyDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html lang=""en"">
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
          <script src=""https://example.com/script.js"" />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}

export default MyDocument;
```
In this example, a custom script tag is added to the HTML structure of the document.
Subfolders Documentation:
Subfolder: ./uploaded_projects\Next-Shopify\next-shopify-starter-main\pages\products
Code Snippets and Examples: #### Common Use Cases

The following example demonstrates how to use the `ProductPage` component by passing it `productData` as a prop.

**Example: Rendering a Product Page**
```jsx
import ProductPage from './[product]';

// Assuming productData is fetched or provided
const productData = { /* product details */ };

const Product = () => {
  return <ProductPage productData={productData} />;
};
```
This example highlights the basic usage of the `ProductPage` component, where `productData` is passed as a prop to render a product page. Note that in a real application, `productData` would be fetched using `getStaticProps` as shown in the `[product].js` file's code.

#### Integration Examples

Since only a single file (`[product].js`) is provided in the specified folder, there are no additional integration examples available. However, it is implied that the `ProductPage` component is designed to be used in conjunction with server-side rendering, as hinted by the mention of `getStaticProps` in the example above.

**Best Practice:** When using the `ProductPage` component, ensure that you have fetched the necessary `productData` using `getStaticProps` or another data fetching mechanism.

**Additional Information:** For more details on server-side rendering and data fetching in Next.js, please refer to the official Next.js documentation.

**Related Components:**

**Design Patterns**

The `utils` folder, specifically the `helpers.js` file, follows a modular architecture. Each function within the file serves a distinct purpose, contributing to the overall organization and maintainability of the codebase.

This modular approach enables developers to easily locate and modify specific functions without affecting other components. The architecture also facilitates the reuse of functions across the application, reducing duplication and promoting efficient development.

**Key Components and Interactions**

The `helpers.js` file comprises several key components that interact with each other and with external Shopify-related functions. These components include:

* `saveLocalData` and `getLocalData`: These functions manage local storage, allowing the application to save and retrieve data.
* `createShopifyCheckout` and `updateShopifyCheckout`: These functions interact with the Shopify platform, leveraging imports from `@/lib/shopify`.
* `getCartSubTotal`: This function calculates cart subtotals.

The components interact through function calls, with some functions relying on the results of others. For instance, `saveLocalData` relies on `getLocalData`.

**Technical Decisions**

The modular architecture of the `helpers.js` file suggests a deliberate choice to promote maintainability and reusability. By separating each function into discrete components, developers can easily modify or replace individual functions without affecting the entire application.

This approach also indicates a performance consideration, as duplicate functions are minimized, reducing unnecessary computations.

While specific scalability approaches are not explicitly mentioned, the modular architecture suggests a potential for easier horizontal scaling, as individual components can be optimized or modified independently.

**Code Example**

```javascript
// Sample usage of helpers.js functions
const cartSubTotal = getCartSubTotal();
saveLocalData('cartSubTotal', cartSubTotal);
const localData = getLocalData('cartSubTotal');
```

**Cross-References**

```javascript
/**
 * Saves local data
 * @param {Array} cart - Cart items
 * @param {string} checkoutId - Checkout ID
 * @param {string} checkoutUrl - Checkout URL
 */
const cart = [...]; // Initialize cart items
const checkoutId = 'abc123'; // Initialize checkout ID
const checkoutUrl = 'https://example.com/checkout'; // Initialize checkout URL
saveLocalData(cart, checkoutId, checkoutUrl);
```

Expected Output:
The `saveLocalData` function will save the provided cart items, checkout ID, and checkout URL locally.

##### Creating a Shopify Checkout

This example illustrates how to create a Shopify checkout using the `createShopifyCheckout` function. This function takes an object with `variantId` and `variantQuantity` as parameters and returns a promise that resolves with checkout data.

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a Shopify checkout
 * @param {Object} newItem - Checkout item details
 * @param {string} newItem.variantId - Variant ID
 * @param {number} newItem.variantQuantity - Variant quantity
 * @returns {Promise} Resolves with checkout data
 */
const newItem = {
  variantId: 'xyz789', // Initialize variant ID
  variantQuantity: 2 // Initialize variant quantity
};
createShopifyCheckout(newItem).then((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Log checkout data
});
```

#### Common Use Cases

The following example demonstrates how to use the `ProductPage` component by passing it `productData` as a prop.

**Example: Rendering a Product Page**
```jsx
import ProductPage from './[product]';

// Assuming productData is fetched or provided
const productData = { /* product details */ };

const Product = () => {
  return <ProductPage productData={productData} />;
};
```
This example highlights the basic usage of the `ProductPage` component, where `productData` is passed as a prop to render a product page. Note that in a real application, `productData` would be fetched using `getStaticProps` as shown in the `[product].js` file's code.

#### Integration Examples

Since only a single file (`[product].js`) is provided in the specified folder, there are no additional integration examples available. However, it is implied that the `ProductPage` component is designed to be used in conjunction with server-side rendering, as hinted by the mention of `getStaticProps` in the example above.

**Best Practice:** When using the `ProductPage` component, ensure that you have fetched the necessary `productData` using `getStaticProps` or another data fetching mechanism.

**Additional Information:** For more details on server-side rendering and data fetching in Next.js, please refer to the official Next.js documentation.

**Folder Overview**
The `context` folder primarily focuses on managing critical application-wide functionality through React context providers. As of now, the available information only encompasses the cart management aspect within e-commerce applications. However, given the generic nature of the folder's setup, it can be inferred that this folder is likely to contain other context providers for different application functionalities.

**Purpose and Scope**
This folder is responsible for providing centralized management systems for various aspects of the application, starting with cart functionality. The core problem it solves is to enable components to access and modify shared data (e.g., cart data) without requiring direct communication between these components. 

The primary users/consumers of this code are likely other components within the application that require access to the managed data. For example, cart-related components can utilize the `CartContext` to access and modify cart information.

Currently, the explicitly defined boundaries and capabilities include managing cart data through three contexts created using the `createContext` hook from React: `CartContext`, `AddToCartContext`, and `UpdateCartQuantityContext`.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

**Design Patterns**
The `context` folder primarily employs the React Context API, a design pattern for sharing data between components without manual prop passing.

The implementation in `Store.js` utilizes the following architectural patterns:
*   Three separate contexts: `CartContext`, `AddToCartContext`, and `UpdateCartQuantityContext`, each with its own provider component (`CartProvider`).
*   The `CartProvider` component wraps the application, providing the cart context to its descendants.

**Technical Decisions**
Key architectural choices in the `context` folder include:

*   Utilizing the `useState` hook to manage cart data locally.
*   Using the `useEffect` hook to:
    *   Initialize cart data from local storage.
    *   Listen for changes to the cart data, ensuring synchronization with the Shopify checkout.

These technical decisions enable efficient data sharing between components and maintain cart data persistence across sessions.

**Component Interactions**
The `CartProvider` component is the central hub for cart-related data sharing. It provides the necessary context to its descendant components, enabling them to access and update cart information.

**Relationships and Dependencies**
The `context` folder relies on the React Context API for data sharing. The individual contexts (`CartContext`, `AddToCartContext`, and `UpdateCartQuantityContext`) are dependent on their respective provider components, which are managed by the `CartProvider`.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

#### Common Use Cases

The `Store.js` file provides context API hooks for managing cart data. Here are some common use cases:

**Using `useCartContext` to Access Cart Data**

```jsx
import { useCartContext } from './Store';

function CartComponent() {
  const [cart, checkoutUrl, isLoading] = useCartContext();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Cart</h2>
      <ul>
        {cart.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.variantId}>{item.name} x {item.variantQuantity}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>Checkout URL: {checkoutUrl}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Expected Inputs and Outputs**

* `useCartContext` returns an array containing `cart`, `checkoutUrl`, and `isLoading`.
* `cart` is an array of objects with `variantId`, `name`, and `variantQuantity` properties.
* `checkoutUrl` is a string representing the URL for checking out.
* `isLoading` is a boolean indicating whether the cart data is loading.

**Using `useAddToCartContext` to Add Items to the Cart**

```jsx
import { useAddToCartContext } from './Store';

function ProductComponent() {
  const addToCart = useAddToCartContext();

  const handleAddToCart = () => {
    const newItem = {
      variantId: 'variant-1',
      name: 'Product 1',
      variantQuantity: 1,
    };
    addToCart(newItem);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Product 1</h2>
      <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Integration Examples

The `useCartContext` and `useAddToCartContext` hooks can be used together to manage cart data in a child component. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { useCartContext, useAddToCartContext } from './Store';

function CartComponent() {
  const [cart, checkoutUrl, isLoading] = useCartContext();
  const addToCart = useAddToCartContext();

  const handleAddToCart = () => {
    const newItem = {
      variantId: 'variant-1',
      name: 'Product 1',
      variantQuantity: 1,
    };
    addToCart(newItem);
  };

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Cart</h2>
      <ul>
        {cart.map((item) => (
          <li key={item.variantId}>{item.name} x {item.variantQuantity}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <p>Checkout URL: {checkoutUrl}</p>
      <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Best Practices**

* Always use the `useCartContext` hook to access cart data in child components.
* Use the `useAddToCartContext` hook to add new items to the cart.
* Ensure that the `cart` array is not mutated directly. Instead, use the `addToCart` function to update the cart data.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

The `inter_rs` folder is located within the `lib` directory of the project. As no specific documentation is provided for this folder, the details below focus on the `shopify.js` file mentioned in the context.

#### Component Overview

The `inter_rs` folder does not have explicit documentation. However, based on the provided context and the traditional use of such a folder, we can infer its purpose. Typically, the `inter_rs` folder would contain Rust code for interacting with Shopify, assuming this project involves Rust and Shopify integration.

Unfortunately, without direct documentation or files within the `inter_rs` folder, it's impossible to accurately describe its contents or functionality. However, the following information about the `shopify.js` file can provide context for potential inter-module relationships.

#### Component Dependencies

- **shopify.js file dependencies**: There is no information provided on which files or libraries the `shopify.js` file depends on. It's clear that `shopify.js` doesn't import any other files based on the given context.
- **Data flow and shared resources**: No specific details about data flow or shared resources are available due to a lack of documentation on interactions within the `inter_rs` folder or between `shopify.js` and the `inter_rs` folder.

#### Communication Patterns

- **Inter-module communication**: As there is no direct documentation for the `inter_rs` folder and only context about `shopify.js`, communication patterns between modules are not explicitly stated.
- **Event handling**: No specific event handling mechanism is mentioned or implied in the provided information.
- **State management**: There is no information on how state is managed between modules or within the `inter_rs` folder.
- **Resource sharing**: Without explicit details on shared resources or communication patterns, it's unclear how resources might be shared between components within the `inter_rs` folder or with the `shopify.js` file.

In summary, due to the absence of direct documentation for the `inter_rs` folder, we can only speculate on its purpose and cannot provide accurate details about its components, dependencies, data flow, or communication patterns.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.

#### Common Use Cases

The `shopify.js` module provides several functions for interacting with Shopify. Here are some complete, runnable examples:

```javascript
// Import the necessary functions from shopify.js
import { getAllProductsInCollection, createCheckout } from './shopify';

// Example 1: Retrieving all products in a collection
/**
 * Retrieves all products in a collection.
 *
 * Returns a promise that resolves with an array of products.
 */
getAllProductsInCollection().then((products) => {
  console.log(products);
});

// Example 2: Creating a new checkout
/**
 * Creates a new checkout.
 *
 * @param {string} variantId - The ID of the product variant.
 * @param {number} quantity - The quantity of the product.
 *
 * Returns a promise that resolves with the checkout object.
 */
createCheckout('variant-id', 2).then((checkout) => {
  console.log(checkout);
});
```

#### Integration Examples

See below for an example of how to use the `shopify.js` module functions together:

```javascript
// Retrieve all products in a collection and create a checkout for a specific product
getAllProductsInCollection().then((products) => {
  const product = products.find((product) => product.id === 'product-id');
  if (product) {
    createCheckout(product.variants[0].id, 2).then((checkout) => {
      console.log(checkout);
    });
  } else {
    console.error('Product not found');
  }
});
```

Best practices:

* Use the `getAllProductsInCollection` function to retrieve all products in a collection before creating a checkout.
* Use the `createCheckout` function to create a new checkout for a specific product variant.

Note: The `variant-id` and `product-id` placeholders should be replaced with the actual IDs of the product variants and products, respectively.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation.
