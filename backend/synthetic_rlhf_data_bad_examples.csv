"### 17. API Endpoints

The API has some endpoints for users and orders. Users can register and login. Orders can be created and viewed. The API uses JWT for auth.

Endpoints:
- POST /users/register
- POST /users/login
- GET /users/me
- POST /orders
- GET /orders
- GET /orders/{id}

The API is built with FastAPI and follows REST principles. It returns JSON responses and uses standard HTTP status codes.

Authentication is required for most endpoints except registration and login. The token must be included in the Authorization header.

The API is documented using Swagger UI at /docs endpoint.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from root-level files and immediate child folders into cohesive, accurate project documentation.

Key Requirements:
- Create high-level project documentation that provides a clear overview of the entire system
- Synthesize information from both files and folders documentations to create a complete picture
- Maintain consistent terminology and technical accuracy
- Focus on project-wide patterns, architectures, and relationships
- Include only information that is explicitly present in the source documentation

"### 18. Database Models

The database has tables for users and orders. The User model has fields like id, email, and password. The Order model has fields like id, user_id, and status.

The models use SQLAlchemy ORM. The database is PostgreSQL. The models are defined in the app/db/models folder.

Relationships exist between models. A user can have many orders. Orders belong to users.

The database schema is managed with Alembic migrations.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive folder-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from multiple files and subfolders into cohesive, accurate documentation.

"### 19. Security Implementation

The app uses JWT tokens for security. Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. The SECRET_KEY is used to sign tokens.

Authentication flow:
1. User logs in with username/password
2. System validates credentials
3. JWT token is generated
4. Token is sent to client
5. Client uses token for subsequent requests

The token contains user information and expiration time. It's validated on each request.

Security best practices are followed like password hashing and token expiration.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation.

"### 20. Error Handling

Errors in the API are handled by returning appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages. Common errors include validation errors, authentication errors, and not found errors.

The error response format is JSON with a message field. The API uses FastAPI's built-in exception handling.

Example error response:
```json
{
  "detail": "Not found"
}
```

Errors are logged for debugging purposes.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from root-level files and immediate child folders into cohesive, accurate project documentation.

The app uses environment variables for configuration. These are loaded from a .env file or the system environment.

Config variables include database connection, security settings, and API settings.

The config is managed by the app/core/config.py file which uses Pydantic for validation.
