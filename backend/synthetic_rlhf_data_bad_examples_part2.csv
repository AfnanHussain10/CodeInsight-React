"### 22. Project Structure

The project has several folders:
- app: main code
- alembic: database stuff
- tests: some tests

The app folder has subfolders:
- api: endpoints
- core: config
- crud: database operations
- db: models
- schemas: data validation

This structure follows some kind of architecture pattern but I'm not sure which one.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from root-level files and immediate child folders into cohesive, accurate project documentation.

Key Requirements:
- Create high-level project documentation that provides a clear overview of the entire system
- Synthesize information from both files and folders documentations to create a complete picture
- Maintain consistent terminology and technical accuracy
- Focus on project-wide patterns, architectures, and relationships
- Include only information that is explicitly present in the source documentation

**Directory Organization**
[Describe the high-level directory structure]

**Component Organization**
[Explain how components are organized within directories]

**Architectural Pattern**
[Identify and explain the architectural pattern used]

**File Naming Conventions**
[Describe any file naming conventions used]

Guidelines:
1. Synthesize information across all files and folders to create a unified narrative
2. Preserve technical accuracy and specificity from source documentation
3. Highlight common patterns and relationships
4. Use consistent terminology throughout",1,0.0

"### 23. Data Flow

Data flows through the system like this:
1. Request comes in
2. FastAPI processes it
3. Data goes to database
4. Response sent back

The app uses some kind of MVC pattern maybe. The models are in the db folder. The views are the API endpoints. The controllers are somewhere else.

Data validation happens with Pydantic schemas. Database operations use SQLAlchemy ORM.

There might be some caching but I don't see it in the code.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from root-level files and immediate child folders into cohesive, accurate project documentation.

"### 24. Testing Strategy

The project has some tests in the tests folder. They test the API endpoints and maybe some other stuff.

Tests use pytest probably. There might be unit tests and integration tests but I'm not sure.

To run tests you probably do something like:
```
pytest
```

Test coverage is unknown. There's no CI/CD information in the docs.","You are a technical documentation expert creating comprehensive project-level documentation. Your task is to synthesize information from root-level files and immediate child folders into cohesive, accurate project documentation.

"### 25. Deployment Process

The app can be deployed with Docker. Just use docker-compose up and it works.

Production deployment might be different but there's no info about it.

The app needs PostgreSQL database. Environment variables should be set somewhere.

"### 26. Performance Considerations

The app uses FastAPI which is fast. Database queries might be optimized but I don't know how.

There's no caching mentioned. No performance benchmarks are provided.
